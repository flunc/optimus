> An incomplete collection of experimental monad transformers and accessories

Inspired by:
* https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers
* https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl

Contributions, issues and general discussions are welcome.

Disclaimer: The project in its current state should be considered just a sandbox or dumping ground of ideas. It is not a
complete library in any sense of the word and has not been thoroughly tested ... expect bugs. It may eventuate into
something one day, however today is not that day.
